Hello there! I am a first year PhD student at the IMT School of Advanced Studies Lucca, supervied by Professor Pietrini. Broadly speaking, I am interested in using computational modelling to investigate aberrant reward processing in antisocial individuals (I know, Mindhunter stuff). 

In my free time I enjoy playing badminton and bouldering, or lurking on Skyscanner for cheap flights.    

I am always happy to know more people and to share my experience as a graduate student in Italy! If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on anything, feel free to drop me an email :D
